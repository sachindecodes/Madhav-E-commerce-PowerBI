## 📊 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze e-commerce sales performance.  
The goal is to **showcase dashboard design and visualization skills** using a **sample dataset**.

## 🔑 Key Metrics
- **438K** – Total Sales Amount  
- **37K** – Total Profit  
- **5615** – Total Quantity Sold  
- **121K** – Average Order Value (AOV)  

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- **State-wise Sales** → Maharashtra leads in sales.
